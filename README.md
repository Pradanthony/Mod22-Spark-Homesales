# Mod22-Spark-Homesales
Spark SQL was used in this activity to analyse and query key metrics from home sales data.
Key metrics such as average prices of 4 bedroom homes, 3 bed room homes and homes with certain conditions were found.
The processing time of the query with CSV file, cached and parquet data was compared.
parquet data file was the fastest to process the queries. It reduces the process time when we run queries.
